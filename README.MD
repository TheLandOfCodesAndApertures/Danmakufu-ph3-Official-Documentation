# Danmakufu ph3 Documentation

This is the Offline Documentation for Touhou Danmakufu ph3 as downloaded from the official website. The backup was made October 2, 2018 in advance of the Geocities Japan termination of service.

The files here were downloaded from <http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-Oakland/9951/pre/th_dnh_ph3.html>.

The official documentation has since moved to <https://touhougc.web.fc2.com/products/th_dnh_help_v3.html>.

The site for this repository is live at <https://thelandofcodesandapertures.github.io/Danmakufu-ph3-Official-Documentation/th_dnh_help_v3.html>.

The HTML files hosted here have been converted to UTF-8; this has been done so they can be displayed properly on GitHub Pages.
